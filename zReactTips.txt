It is always advised to extract out similar html to a separate component.

LifeCycle Methods are very common in react we should always use them wherever possible.
ComponentWillMount gets called both on server and client sides if you are doing server side rendering.
ComponentDidMount has an advantage that window object is always available inside the method because
 it gets called after the component gets mounted on the DOM

 Use React Performance Tools

 For only react implementations see v3-17

 After v3-17 redux implementation starts.
Redux:
 Its basically a tree of data similarly like react is a tree of components.
 Each component tree can subscribe to particular branch of tree.

 Reducer :
  It's a function which takes a state and an action and returns a new state based upon the action.
   Redux Loop:
    Event Fired -> Event Handled -> Action Dispatched To Redux Reducer -> Reducer Taked the action and the current state and returns a new state
    -> React Has Subscribed to the state change event -> Redux notifies that the state has changed to react->
    React gets the new state and rerenders the dom based upon the diff in new virtual dom and old virtual dom
